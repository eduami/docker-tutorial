# Abstract
Container-based deployment is rapidly becoming a de facto standard for system deployments, covering small web applications to applications spanning across clusters.

During this talk, the speaker will discuss how you can architect your applications to use with Docker using a container-based deployment approach. He will introduce you to Docker, its architecture, and its future prospects. He will also give you an insight into what Docker is not.

Finally, the speaker will provide a demo about how to package a web application, which uses database services, with Docker and achieve auto-scalability using Kubernetes cluster.
